## Usage

### Starting the Agent

Run the main agent script:

```bash
python Agent.py
```

The agent will start an interactive session where you can ask questions and request analysis.

### Example Commands

```
what do you want from the agent? : Analyze the Excel file food.xlsx
what do you want from the agent? : Extract and analyze all charts from the spreadsheet
what do you want from the agent? : Generate a comprehensive report of the data quality
what do you want from the agent? : exit
```

### Sample Analysis Output

The agent generates structured JSON reports with detailed information:

```json
{
  "file_summary": {
    "file_size": "2.5 MB",
    "total_sheets": "3 sheets",
    "total_charts": "12 charts",
    "total_images": "5 images",
    "extraction_status": "success"
  },
  "sheets": {
    "Sheet1": {
      "rows_count": "150 rows",
      "columns_count": "8 columns",
      "column_names": ["Date", "Product", "Sales", "Region"],
      "data_types": {
        "Date": "date",
        "Product": "string",
        "Sales": "numeric",
        "Region": "string"
      },
      "statistics": {
        "Sales": {
          "mean": 1250.5,

          "max": 5000,
          "quartiles": [800, 1100, 1600]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "chart_analyses": [
    {
      "chart_file": "Sheet1_Chart_1.png",
      "analysis": "This bar chart shows sales trends over time...",
